Description:

This Chrome extension was intended to modify Instagram's data recommendations to potentially reduce time spent on the platform. However, due to updates in Instagram's privacy policy, the extension's core functionality is no longer operational.

Current Status:

DEPRECATED. This extension is currently not functional as it relies on methods that are no longer supported by Instagram's API or privacy policy.

Potential Future Use:

While the original purpose of manipulating recommendations is no longer achievable, the extension's codebase could potentially be repurposed for other Instagram data-related tasks, subject to Instagram's API and privacy guidelines. However, significant modifications would likely be required.
